# neural_network_image_classification

This repository contains two files: one in .ipynb format and one in .py format.

## File Descriptions

- `neural_network_image_classification.ipynb`: This file contains a simple neural network implemented to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST collection. The Fashion-MNIST collection, consists of grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels (uint8; 0-255) representing 10 different clothing categories. The class labels are stored as integer values from 0 to 9.
- `neural_network_image_classification.py`: This Python script file contains the code of the same neural network implemented for image classification from the Fashion-MNIST collection.

## Project Details

In this project, the following steps were performed:

1. Normalization of the training and test data.
2. Implementation of a small convolutional network for image classification.
3. Training of the implemented network using the training data, with validation performed using the test data.
4. Generation of a graph showing the learning error (Loss) and classification accuracy (Accuracy) for both the training and test (validation) data.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `neural_network_image_classification.ipynb` file using Google Colab.
3. Run the code cells to train and test the neural network.
4. Analyze the results and experiment with different configurations.
